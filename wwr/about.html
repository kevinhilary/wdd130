            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2012 along the banks of the Tana River, our rafting company began with a small team of
                passionate adventurers
                who shared a dream of bringing people closer to nature through the thrill of white-water rafting. What
                started as
                weekend trips for friends soon grew into a trusted outdoor adventure company, known for its safety,
                expertise, and
                unforgettable river experiences. Over the years, weve expanded our routes, trained local guides, and
                welcomed thousands
                of explorers from around the world—all while staying true to our love for the river and commitment to
                sustainable
                tourism.
